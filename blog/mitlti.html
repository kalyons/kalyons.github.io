						<h2><i>Live. Laugh. Lead.</i></h2>
						<h5>July 30th, 2015</h5>
						<p>Nobody ever just tells you how to lead, how to carry yourself in times of pressure, how to evoke change among those around you. Figure it out on your own. Best of luck, write your own script on this one...</p>
						<p>This view of leadership had been fully my own for much of my early life. Sure I would be a known figure in a group I participated in, a 7th-grade-class-president-esque state of affairs. Yet at the time it felt more like a title than a responsibility, a cumbersome rank than an obligation. Without external guidance on <i>how to lead</i>, or <i>what it even means to lead</i>, it became a stuggle to indentify my role within larger groups.</p>
						<p>My early high school years quickened the pace of my transformation into more of a natural leader, yet not at the rate that would be necessary for me and thus those around me to reach ultimate potential in numerous endeavors, whether it be academic, athletic, social, personal. That rate would only get to speed and alter a personal world lens through which to lead with participation in LTI, <a href="http://lti.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT's Leadership Training Institute</a>.</p>
						<p>A simple school-wide e-mail presented itself to me, exuding the following message about the opportunity:</p>
						<blockquote><font size="3"><i>Currently recruiting students! The Leadership Training Institute @ MIT:  The Leadership Training Institute is a mentoring program founded and run by undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Run during the spring semester, the program focuses on teaching high school students the fundamentals of leadership and supplying them with the tools to make a difference in their own community. If accepted, all students are awarded a full scholarship for the weekly 12-session program from February 2015 to May 2015.  Who should apply?  Students with leadership potential, self-motivation, passion for learning, and capability to overcome adversity.</i></font></blockquote>
						<p>Hesitant at first? Yes. I'm not usually one for third-party extracirriculars, elitist opportunities for resume advancement. <b>Yet this seemed different.</b> When looking at the bottom 4 criteria organized in a neat list, I iterated through as such...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"leadership potential" - I have a whole lot of that, waiting to be tapped...</li>
							<li>"self-motivation" - &#x2713;&#x2713;&#x2713;</li>
							<li>"passion for learning" - always craving for more</li>
							<li>"capability to overcome adversity" - ...</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Item 4, index 3 - this is where my process of self-reflection began. I am so grateful for the stability and constancy that has endured throughout my childhood, yet in a sense it has left parts of me <i>empty</i>. Had I ever truly overcome <i>adversity</i>? Beyond the casual ankle sprain, the difficult assignment, the unstable friendship - what <i>adversity</i> had I to reference? Coming to this realization may appear to be a positive sight; it served to me as more of a wake-up call. And the alarm clock ringing in my ear was those three letters, inviting me into a community of acceptance, understanding and unprecedented growth.</p>
						<p>Fast forward 6 months to May 2015, MIT's campus, 34-101, I stand and present genuine material, material I had to push through <i>adversity</i> to develop, to a room of over one hundred audience members. This must be one of the most satisfying experiences of my life. The road to that moment was long, yet all the while too quick and fleeting in hindsight. To get to 05-03-2015, I started back at 02 and 01, preparing my application to showcase my personal skills.</p>

						<p>- <b>I was accepted into the selective program</b>, hailed as "the most competitive applicant pool to date" by the program's managing director. Remaining humble and proud, I stuck to my path and mentally prepared for the experiences that would follow.</p>
						<p>- <b>I immediately connected with those closest to me</b>, two students from Weymouth High School who also were attending. Sharing with them common concerns and goals made the transition into the program a much more secure environment.</p>
						<p>- <b>I let myself go</b> (in all the right ways, not like me as seen in photo top right...). I let walls down not only to enjoy ridiculous games, but also to communicate - what I saw as a positive leader and role model, personal expectations, ongoing struggles.</p>
						<p>- <b>I thought. A lot more than I ever had.</b> Small circumstances now became invaluable opportunites to reflect upon the human experience and my role within it. What can I do to lead any given situation, no matter how insignificant it may seem upon first glance...</p>

						</div>
						<p>- <b>I observed and connected.</b> In my community, I began to recognize a pervasive ambivalence toward future goals and aspiratons, a passive world view I saw waste away extraordinary individuals. Engagement was imperative <b>in the here and now, with a topic that would create that same adversity and discomfort I had avoided for so long.</b> This topic would be the one I had grown to love over the past few years - computer science. Its capacity to foster logical thinking and problem solving skills was one I had to capitalize upon to affect my community in a meaningful manner. Combine this with district-wide collaboration and vertical alignment through high school student mentorship, and you've got yourself <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/weymouthps.org/beyond-the-code/" target="_blank">Beyond the Code</a>.</p>
						<p>- Most of all, I made a difference. Other than <a href="http://kevinalyons.com/experiences.html#btc" target="_blank">the statistical impact of my program</a>, the ideals and behaviors which I instilled within a community, even if to the slightest degree, were significant and ultimately powerful for those involved. As I allude to in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odsx77Tl4ow" target="_blank">my presentation in one of MIT's larger lecture halls</a>, an e-mail from a student expressing personal advocacy and confidence is the true purpose for my altruism...</p><br>
						<blockquote>Hi Mr. Lyons,<br><br>
							My name is <i>ommitted</i>. I am in Mr.Whitaker's 7th grade classroom in Chapman, and I am <b><u>in love</u></b> with computers and programming. I have tried programming pictures on some website earlier a year ago and I have never stopped. I wanted to ask you if I could join your course afterschool. I have no clue if it is full or not, but I want to let you know that, <b><u>I am not one of those students that will waste your time</u></b>. I only want to join because this type of afterschool class is <b><u>the only thing I have interest in</u></b>.</blockquote>
							<p><font size="2"><i>* Formatting taken verbatim from e-mail, 04-12-2015.</i></font></p>
							<p>The me before the LTI experience would never have the confidence to send such a message, to express my passions and requests so cogently. The me after LTI realized that not only could I do so with ease and fluidity - I could furthermore compel those around me to do the same. The power to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I9jn4Clp4&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">make peers genuinely passionate about their work</a>, whether it be coding or some other field, is a notable achievement of a leader. I could <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdCZZagTQ40&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">stand in front of my town's school committee</a> and argue for more attention to STEM in public educaton.</p>
							<p>This was no easy task. There was <i>adversity</i>. Yet with a pragmatic optimisim that connects groups to make opportunities happen, I am far better for it today.</p>
							<p>And that is the definition of a leader.</p>
