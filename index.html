Biochemical engineering and computational chemistry fields appeal to me as the ideal blend of CS with real-world, immediate application.

Since then, I have had so many gratifying experiences through the game and now start both sides of the ball as a senior captain.

I am fortunate enough to come up through local town programs and the Weymouth High School Basketball Program to become a starting captain heading into my senior year. Furthermore, I have been able to coach the youth in my community in grades 2-4 for multiple years, thus giving back to a cause that meant so much to me.

												<p>My passion for math is evident dating back to primary school years, yet I never had an opportunity to truly allow it to shine until my junior year where I joined the Weymouth High School Math Team, dubbed weyMath. My educational experience since my decision to join has been completely changed for the better. With a refreshing group of intellectuals surrounding me, I was exposed to a different side of the social spectrum (in contrast with the largely athletic paradigm I lived in prior). I now see the best of both worlds - mental and physical strength - and am better suited to deal with both. Heading into my senior year, I am now a captain of this team. Coming off a divisional championship in 2015, our team is looking to stay sharp and maintain our high ranking. Thus, I am coordinating many practice opportunities <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/240483296106262/">on social media</a> in the offeason before we return to weekly drill routines in mid-September. Personal pride in the team's success is certainly my first priority, yet so too is individual achievement. I was awarded the 2015 Gold Medal for highest scorer on the team, including one perfect score to seal a victory for my team. I am also looking to coordinate additional competition opportunities for my team as is deserved. Administation and I are working during the summer of 2015 to compete at the <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/News/Events/MathMeet/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute Math Meet</a> and the <a href="http://hmmt.mit.edu/">Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament</a> in the upcoming fall season.  I work with press relations and was responsible for announcing our team's success in local media outlets.

This application is critical for the Development and Quality Assurance Departments in maintaining continuity across multiple versions and releases under a common gateway service. This work allowed me to apply my knowledge of recursive definitions file parsing while also picking up many new skills, including cross-thread UI callbacks, asynchronous iteration and improved model-view-controller separation.

												<p>By far the most transformative experience of my career, the MIT Leadership Training Institute made me realize the deep potential I hold evoke change in those around me. An intensive yet cheerful 12-week program on MIT's Cambridge Campus, LTI's selective application process selected 50 deserving students from the metro-Boston region to participate. In what was hailed as "the most competitive applicant pool to date" by the program's managing director, so many amazing students flocked to campus every Sunday to discover their ability to make an impact within respective communities. After being instructed to find a need or shortcoming in my community and develop a solution, I founded the non-profit organization Beyond the Code. Please see the Beyond the Code documentation on my profile for more details. During the Closing Ceremonies of the program, I was selected as one of only three students to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odsx77Tl4ow">present my findings</a> in one of the largest lecture halls on campus.  I also had to compile <a href="./assets/[PDF] Final Project Proposal Outline.pdf">elaborate documentation</a> for this project.

												<br>
												<p>I founded the non-profit organization Beyond the Code in the spring of 2015, my junior year. This is a unique computer science mentorship program that pairs knowledgeable and passionate high school students with those in younger grades, currently 3-8, to develop an understanding of problem solving and logical thinking skills for future years. The ability to code and "think like a programmer," as our slogan reads, is a universal skill I observed as non-existent. Within our first session in the Spring of 2015, we received a tremendous interest from youth, with registration filling up to capacity within 36 hours of initial release and ultimately reaching 70 students in our first three schools of operation. Parents, students and faculty alike praised the opportunity as well needed in the current technical age. I have plans in place to pass the role of director to an already-selected rising junior during SY 15-16, followed by an already-selected student for SY 16-17. This will ensure a sustainable, replicable mentorship program that shall continue to make a difference years after my graduation. Check out our <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/weymouthps.org/beyond-the-code/">website</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I9jn4Clp4&feature=youtu.be">Spring 2015 film</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/weymouthps.org/beyond-the-code/resources/spring-2015-resources">OpenSource curriculum</a>.

												<p>Student Voice is a critical group on the Weymouth High School campus that seeks to empower students on a number of issues and encourage practical problem solving to meet administrators with resolution. Student Voice is responsible for holding the multi-annual Student Voice Summit, which will pick back up in the fall of SY 15-16. At the Summit, students from all over the school, spanning interests, disciplines and notorieties are selected by teachers and administrators for a day-long dynamic forum on current shortcomings in Weymouth High School culture and climate. Rather than becoming a session to vent about injustices done unto students over the years, the Summit compels student to reach meaningful solutions to issues including technology misuse, faculty-student relationships and media outlets for information. This past year myself and three other peers were named the new directors of the program by our principal and given the task to reinvigorate its decline over the previous school year. I look forward to collaborating across the school in such an open, inviting forum for positive long-term solutions that are genuinely student-born.
